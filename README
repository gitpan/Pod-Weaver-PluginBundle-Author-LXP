VERSION

    v1.0.0.

SYNOPSIS
    In weaver.ini:

        [@Author::LXP]

DESCRIPTION
    This Pod::Weaver plugin bundle configures Pod::Weaver the way CPAN
    author "LXP" uses it, achieving the same result as these entries in a
    weaver.ini file:

        ;; SETUP ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

        ; "A bundle for the most commonly-needed prep work for a POD
        ; document."  Not sure what it actually does, but it's probably
        ; important.
        [@CorePrep]

        ; "Stopwords" are words that a spell checker might otherwise flag
        ; as misspelt.  This plugin adds some words based on the
        ; distribution's content and gathers explicitly defined ones at the
        ; top so that they are also honoured.
        [-StopWords]

        ; Provide a "list" POD formatter for easier definition of lists.
        [-Transformer]
        transformer = List
